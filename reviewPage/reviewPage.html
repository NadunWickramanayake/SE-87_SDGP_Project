    <p class="image-description">Based on my experience using the mental health app with the 
        three features, I found it to be an incredibly helpful resource. 
        The depression level assessment feature was easy to use and the questions 
        felt relevant and easy to understand. The chatbot feature provided a safe space 
        to share my feelings and receive support, and I appreciated that the app used 
        my chatbot interactions to generate a depression level. 
        The report generated by the app was informative and provided me with actionable steps
         to take to improve my mental health.Overall, I would highly recommend this app to 
         anyone who is struggling with their mental health. The app's user-friendly interface 
         and helpful features make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve 
         their mental well-being.</p>
