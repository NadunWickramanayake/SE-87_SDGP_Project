In fact, the chronic feelings of sadness and low mood they experience may have been around for so long that they feel normal.

Symptoms of severe depression Insomnia, Irritability, Loss of interest in activities that used to be enjoyable, Hopelessness, Persistent thoughts of something bad happening, Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts, In very severe cases, psychotic symptoms, Inability to take care of oneself, such as eating, bathing, or fulfilling family or work responsibilities.
